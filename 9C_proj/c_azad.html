    <p style="font-size:19"> Chandrashekhar Azad(Original:<i> Chandrashekhar Tiwari</i>) was an Indian revelutionary who organized and led a band of youth freedom fighters during India's independence movement.
      While participating in Gandhi's <em>non-cooperation movement</em> in Benaras, he gave the name <i>Azad</i> (meaning <i>free</i>)</p>
    <p style="font-size:19">On 27th February 1931(today), Azad had planned to meet another revolutionary at the Alfred Park(Now named <i>Chandrashekhar Azad Park</i>).
      But, someone had betrayed him to the police.(Azad's old comrades - <i>Veerabhadra Tiwari</i>, and <i>Yashpal</i> were held responsible for tipping off the police).
      The police arrived at the park and surrounded it on 4 sides, and started firing. His companion, Sukhdev Raj, managed to escape uninjured, but Azad was cornered and he managed to hide behind a tree, where he began to shoot back.
      After a long shootout, Azad shot himself with the last bullet he had, keeping true to his pledge to always remain free, and not to be captured.
