#### Q 24. An infinitely long $$\Pi$$ shaped conductor as shown is fixed horizontally on a flat surface. A capacitor of capacitance $$C$$ is connected as shown. A straight conducting rod of length $$l$$, mass $$m$$ and resistance $$R$$ is placed parallel to the line joining the capacitor as shown. Assume frictionless contact between the rod and the $$\Pi$$ shaped conductor. A constant magnetic field of magnitude $$B$$ is set up vertically, into the plane. The rod is initially given a velocity $$v_0$$ towards the right by an impulsive force. Find the velocity of the rod and the charge on the capacitor as a function of time.

#### Answer:

From Faraday's law, we can write:

$$\dot{q}R + \frac{q}{C} = vBl\tag1$$

Where $$v$$ is the velocity of the rod at any general instant.

And from the Lorentz force and Newton's law, 

$$F = -iBl \Longleftrightarrow \dot{v} = \frac{-\dot{q}Bl}{m}\tag2$$

Differentiating eq (1), and substituting $$\dot{v}$$ from eq (2) into it gives us

$$\ddot{q}R + \dot{q} \left( \frac{1}{C} + \frac{B^2l^2}{m} \right) = 0\tag3$$

For simplicity let's define:

$$\kappa \overset{\text{def}}{=}\frac{1}{C} + \frac{B^2l^2}{m}$$

Solving the differential eq (3),

$$q = C_1 e^{\alpha_1 t} + C_2 e^{\alpha_2 t}$$

Where $$\alpha_1$$ and $$\alpha_2$$ are the roots of the equation $$D^2R+D\kappa = 0$$. Substituting boundary condition, i.e. at $$t=0$$, charge on capacitor $$q=0$$, and initial current $$i_0 = \frac{v_0 Bl}{R}$$, we get:

$$q = \frac{v_0 Bl}{\kappa}\left( 1 - e^{-\frac{\kappa}{R} t} \right)\tag4$$

Here, we see that $$\tau \overset{\text{def}}{=} R / \kappa$$ plays the role of time constant. 

Note that the final charge on the capacitor, at $$t=\infty$$:

$$q\big|_{t=\infty} = \frac{v_0  B l}{\kappa}$$

Further, current as a function of time:

$$i = \dot{q} = \frac{v_0 B l R }{\kappa^2} e^{-t/\tau}\tag5$$

Substituting this is eq (2), and integrating with appropriate limits, we get velocity of the rod as a function of time,

$$v = \frac{v_0 B^2 l^2 R^2}{\kappa^3 m} \left( 1 - e^{-t/\tau}\right) + v_0\tag6$$

Further, we can say that:

$$P = i^2 R$$

$$\implies \int dH = \frac{v_0^2B^2l^2R^3}{\kappa^4} \int_0^\infty e^{-2t/\tau}dt$$

$$\implies H = \frac{v_0^2B^2l^2R^4}{2\kappa^5}\tag7$$

This is the total heat lost due to current in the resistor(rod).

We can also find the final kinetic energy of the rod. 

$$K_{f,rod} = \frac{1}{2} m v_0^2 \left( \frac{B^2l^2R^2}{\kappa^3m} + 1\right) ^2\tag8$$

Also, The final energy stored in the capacitor,

$$E_{capacitor} = \frac{q^2}{2C}$$

$$E = \frac{v_0^2B^2l^2}{2C\kappa^2}\tag9$$
