#### Q12. Find the force of water on a conical dam as shown below. Take the density to be $$\rho$$. Half angle of the cone is $$\phi$$.

#### Idea:

Consider an infinitesimal area $$dA$$ as shown. On this area, due to pressure a force $$\overrightarrow{dF}$$. 

$$\overrightarrow{dF} = P\overrightarrow{dA}$$

This force has 3 components. By careful observation, we can say that,

$$dF_x = dF \cos \phi \sin \theta$$

$$dF_y = dF \cos \phi \cos \theta$$

$$dF_z = dF \sin \phi$$

$$\hat{n} = \cos \phi \sin \theta \hat{i} + \cos \phi \cos \theta \hat{j} + \sin \phi \hat{k}$$

Some other trivial observations are,

$${r \over l} = {R \over L} ( = \tan \phi)$$

$$h \buildrel \rm def  \over = R - r \cos \theta$$

Now, we have,

$$\overrightarrow{dF} = \rho g h (r d\theta dl) \hat{n}$$

$$= \rho g (R - r \cos \theta) ( r d \theta \csc \phi dr) \hat{n}$$

Integrating, we get,

$$\overrightarrow{F} = \rho g H R^2 \hat{i} + \rho g H R^2 {\pi \over 6} \hat{j} + \rho g R^3 {\pi \over 2} \hat{k}$$

Note that,

$$F_x = F_z = (\text{projected area})(\text{Pressure at mean height})$$

$$F_y = (\text{Weight of liquid displaced by body})$$

Which is generally true.
