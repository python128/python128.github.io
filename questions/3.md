#### Q3. Consider a 3D shape whose left end has radius $$1$$m. The shape is circular, with its radius increasing continually as $$r = a^x$$, $$a \in \mathbb{R^+}$$. Assume forces to be acting in the centre of the side (circular) faces on both sides. Consider it to have Young's modulus $$Y$$. Find elongation $$\Delta L$$.

We know that,

$$\Delta L = \frac{FL}{AY}$$

Also, $$r = a^x$$ can be written as $$r = e^{x \ln a}\tag1$$

Elongation in infitesimally small cross section $$dl$$, 

$$dl = \frac{Fdx}{\pi r^2 Y}$$

$$\Delta L = \frac{F}{\pi Y} \int_{1}^{r'} \frac{dx}{r^2}$$

Substituing (1) and corresponding change of limits,

$$\Delta L = \frac{F}{\pi Y} \int_{0}^{L} \frac{dx}{(e^{x \ln a})^2}$$

$$\Delta L = \frac{F}{\pi Y} \left( \frac{-1}{2 \ln a} e^{-2x \ln a} \right) \Biggr|_{0}^{L}$$

$$\therefore \Delta L = \frac{F}{2 \pi Y \ln a} \left( 1 - e^{-2L \ln a} \right)$$

It is interesting to note that if we let $$L \to \infty$$, assuming force $$F$$ on the other end can still be applied, we get that $$e^{-2L \ln a} \to 0$$.

$$\implies \Delta L \Bigr|_{L = \infty} = \frac{F}{2 \pi Y \ln a}$$

So, for an infinitely large object, we can have finite elongation due to tensile forces. (Theoretically).

This is due to the fact that $$e^x$$ rises rather rapidly. So, after some distance, we get that the cross sectional area $$A$$ is much larger than the small $$dx$$ at that point. And, as we know, $$\Delta L \propto \frac{dx}{A}$$. Hence we get this finite elongation.
