#### Q13. In a hollow cylinder, filled with water till a height $$h$$, being rotated at angular velocity $$\omega$$. Its radius is $$R$$. Consider the density of water to be $$\rho$$. Find the moment of inertia of the rotating liquid as function of angular velocity $$\omega$$.

#### Idea:

To find $$H$$,

$$V_i = V_f$$

$$\pi R^2 h = V_{\text{till }H} - V_{paraboloid}$$

$$\implies H = h + {R^2 \omega^2 \over 4g}$$

Equation of parabola is as follows(easily derivable):

$$y = {x^2 \omega^2 \over 2g}$$

Similar analysis gives,

$$\lambda = h - {R^2 \omega^2 \over 4g}$$

Which gives the equation of surface in cylindrical coordinates as,

$$z = h + {\omega^2 \over 2g}\left( r^2 - {R^2 \over 2} \right)$$

Observe that heights increased and decreased is symmetrical about the original height.

Moment of inertia of the liquid can be written as:

$$I_{\text{liquid}} = I_{\text{till H}} - I_{\text{paraboloid, } \lambda \text{ to } H}$$

Final result:

$$I = \pi \rho \left( {R^4 h \over 2} + {R^6 \omega^2 \over 24g} \right)$$
