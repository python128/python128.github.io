#### Q 19. Find the resistance of an ellipse with major axis $$a$$, and minor axis $$b$$, rotated about its major axis, with the parts beyond $$\pm c$$ being cut off as shown in diagram. Its resistivity is $$\rho$$.

---

#### Answer:

By setting up the integral and integrating, we get

$$R = \frac{\rho a}{\pi b^2} \ln \left| \frac{a+c}{a-c} \right|$$

This expression is valid for all $$c < a$$.

For a similarly cut sphere($$a=b$$),

$$R = \frac{\rho}{\pi a} \ln \left| \frac{a+c}{a-c} \right|$$
