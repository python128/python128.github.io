As shown in diagram, 

Let's consider a general point at a radial distance $$x$$ away from the centre of the giant. Let the sphere's radius here be $$r$$.

By the definition of the bulk modulus, we have,

$$\beta = - { dP \over dV } V$$

$$\implies -dP = \beta {dV \over V}$$

---

Here, we need to find gravitational pressure, $$dP$$

$$dP = {dF \over A} = {I \rho dV \over A}$$

Here, $$I$$ refers to the gravitational field due to the planet(within the planet), and $$\rho$$ is its density.

$$dP = \frac{4}{3} \pi G \rho x \left( \rho \frac{dV}{A} \right)$$

$$\implies dP = \frac{4}{3} \pi G \rho^2 x \; dx$$

---

Substituting this expression back and integrating with limits,

$$\int_R^x \frac{4}{3} \pi G \rho^2 x \; dx = \beta \int_{r_0}^r \frac{ 4 \pi r^2 \; dr }{\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}$$

This gives,

$$r = r_0 e^{ { 2\pi G \rho^2 (x^2 - R^2) \over 3 \beta } }$$

Note that, $$G \sim 10^{-11}$$ and $$\beta \sim 10^{10}$$ for most materials.

The order of the exponent's argument is around $$10^{-21}$$, which is clearly negligible.

Further, 

Variation in density of the same body,

Say $$\tilde{\rho}_s$$ is the initial density. Since mass is conserved here,

$$\tilde{\rho}_s V_i = \rho_s V_f$$

We get,

$$\rho_s = \tilde{\rho}_s e^{ { 2 \pi G \rho^2 (R^2 - x^2) \over \beta } }$$
