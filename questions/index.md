1. A metal ring of mass M and radius R is set rotating about an axis going through the diameter. The experiment is conducted in space at an infinite distance. Its angualar velocity is $$\omega$$. Find tension as a function on angle $$\theta$$ from horizontal. [Solution](https://python128.github.io/questions/1)

2. A table with a smooth horizontal surface is rotating with constant angular velocity $$\omega$$ about the vertical axis. A groove is made radially, and a particle is placed at a distance $$a$$ from the centre. Find the trajectory of the particle as a function of the angular displacement $$\theta$$. [Solution](https://python128.github.io/questions/2)

3. Consider a 3D shape whose left end has radius $$1$$m. The shape is circular, with its radius increasing continually as $$r = a^x$$, $$a \in \mathbb{R^+}$$. Assume forces to be acting in the centre of the side (circular) faces on both sides. Consider it to have Young's modulus $$Y$$. Find elongation $$\Delta L$$. [Solution](https://python128.github.io/questions/3)
   
4. Consider the previous 3D shape. Assume the function to be $$r = e^x$$. This shape is rotated with constant angular velocity $$\omega$$ about the axis touching the smaller end. Find elongation $$\Delta L$$. [Solution](https://python128.github.io/questions/4)
5. A frustum is made with inner radius $$a_1$$ and outer radius $$a_2$$ on the short end, and radii $$b_1$$ and $$b_2$$ on the larger side. Find the net thermal resistance offered by the hollow frustum if its total length is $$L$$ and thermal conductivity is $$K$$.[Solution](https://python128.github.io/questions/5)
6. Consider a hollow frustum, closed on both ends. An ideal gas of molar mass M and temperature T is inside it. It is rotated about its short end with constant angular velocity $$\omega$$. The radius on its left end is $$a$$, and its right end is $$b$$. Pressure on its left end is $$P_0$$. The total length is $$L$$. Find pressure profile. ($$P(x)$$) [Solution](https://python128.github.io/questions/6)
7. Find the moment of inertia of an ellipse (lamina) about an axis passing through the centre, perpendicular to the lamina. Consider the ellipse to have semi minor axis of length $$b$$, and semi major axis of length $$a$$. [Solution](https://python128.github.io/questions/7)
8. Find the moment of inertia of a torus about its axis of symmetry. Assume mass $$m$$, major radius $$R$$, minor radius $$a$$. [Solution](https://python128.github.io/questions/8)
9. Find the time of collision of two (point sized) bodies kept at a distance $$R$$ from each other, initially at rest, having equal masses $$M$$. [Answer](https://python128.github.io/questions/9)
10. Consider a charged non conducting hollow cylinder of surface change density $$\sigma$$, radius $$R$$, and length $$L$$. A particle of mass $$m$$, change $$q$$ is dropped at one end of the tube. Find velocity at a general position $$x$$ from the top of cylinder. Given: $$q\sigma < 0$$. Neglect gravity. [Answer](https://python128.github.io/questions/10)
11. Consider an isolated system of length $$L$$ and cross section $$A$$ as shown. There is a moveable, adiabatic wall placed at $${L \over 2}$$. Find net displacement of the wall, final temperatures and pressure. Consider adiabatic gas constant to be $$\gamma$$. Also find work done be the gases on the left and right portions. [Answer](https://python128.github.io/questions/11)
12. Find the force of water on a conical dam as shown below. Take the density to be $$\rho$$. Half angle of the cone is $$\phi$$. [Answer](https://python128.github.io/questions/12)
13. In a hollow cylinder, filled with water till a height $$h$$, being rotated at angular velocity $$\omega$$. Its radius is $$R$$. Consider the density of water to be $$\rho$$. Find the moment of inertia of the rotating liquid as function of angular velocity $$\omega$$. [Answer](https://python128.github.io/questions/13)
14. In [Q 10](https://python128.github.io/questions/10), assuming the cylinder to be of sufficient length, we can say that the particle's velocity will eventually reach the speed of light, $$c$$. This will clearly happen at the midpoint of the cylinder. Find the necessary length of the cylinder assuming the same assumptions as made before. Neglect relativistic effects, and use newtonian mechanics. [Answer](https://python128.github.io/questions/14)
15. Solve [Q 10](https://python128.github.io/questions/10), but consider a conducting neutral cylinder instead. [Answer](https://python128.github.io/questions/15)
16. Find the equation of the curve that light traces as it passes from vacuum to a medium of variable refractive index as given in each sub-part. [Answer](https://python128.github.io/questions/16)
