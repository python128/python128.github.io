# Interesting Questions in PU 1

1. A metal ring of mass M and radius R is set rotating about an exis going through the diameter. The experiment is conducted in space at an infinite distance. Its angualar velocity is <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5Comega" alt="\omega" />. Find tension as a function on angle <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5Ctheta" alt="\theta" /> from horizontal. [Solution](https://python128.github.io/questions/1)

2. A table with a smooth horizontal surface is rotating with constant angular velocity $$\omega$$ about the vertical axis. A groove is made radially, and a particle is placed at a distance $$a$$ from the centre. Find the trajectory of the particle as a function of the angular displacement $$\theta$$. [Solution](https://python128.github.io/questions/2)

3. Consider a 3D shape whose left end has radius $$1$$m. The shape is circular, with its radius increasing continually as $$r = a^x$$, $$a \in \mathbb{R^+}$$. Assume forces to be acting in the centre of the side (circular) faces on both sides. Consider it to have Young's modulus $$Y$$. Find elongation $$\Delta L$$. [Solution](https://python128.github.io/questions/3)
   
4. Consider the previous 3D shape. Assume the function to be $$r = e^x$$. This shape is rotated with constant angular velocity $$\omega$$ about the axis touching the smaller end. Find elongation $$\Delta L$$. [Solution](https://python128.github.io/questions/4)
5. A frustum is made with inner radius $$a_1$$ and outer radius $$a_2$$ on the short end, and radii $$b_1$$ and $$b_2$$ on the larger side. Find the net thermal resistance offered by the hollow frustum if its total length is $$L$$ and thermal conductivity is $$K$$.[Solution](https://python128.github.io/questions/5)
6. Consider a hollow frustum, closed on both ends. An ideal gas of molar mass M and temperature T is inside it. It is rotated about its short end with constant angular velocity $$\omega$$. The radius on its left end is $$a$$, and its right end is $$b$$. Pressure on its left end is $$P_0$$. The total length is $$L$$. Find pressure profile. ($$P(x)$$) [Solution](https://python128.github.io/questions/6)
7. Find the moment of inertia of an ellipse (lamina) about an axis passing through the centre, perpendicular to the lamina. Consider the ellipse to have semi minor axis of length $$b$$, and semi major axis of length $$a$$. [Solution](https://python128.github.io/questions/7)
8. Find the moment of inertia of a torus about its axis of symmetry. Assume mass $$m$$, major radius $$R$$, minor radius $$a$$. [Solution](https://python128.github.io/questions/8)
