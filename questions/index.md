1. A metal ring of mass M and radius R is set rotating about an exis going through the diameter. The experiment is conducted in space at an infinite distance. Its angualar velocity is <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5Comega" alt="\omega" />. Find tension as a function on angle <img src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5Ctheta" alt="\theta" /> from horizontal.
