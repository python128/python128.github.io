#### Q2. A table with a smooth horizontal surface is rotating with constant angular velocity $$\omega$$ about the vertical axis. A groove is made radially, and a particle is placed at a distance $$a$$ from the centre. Find the trajectory of the particle as a function of the angular displacement $$\theta$$.

Solution:

Assuming, table to be infinitely large(ball doesn't fall off). 

Net force radially outward = $$mR\omega^2$$

Let $$r$$ be the radial position at any time.

$$\ddot{x} = \omega^2 r$$

$$v \frac{dv}{dr} = \omega^2 r$$

$$\int_{0}^{v} v dv = \int_{a}^{r} \omega^2 r dr$$

$$v = \omega \sqrt{r^2 - a^2} $$

$$\int_{a}^{r} \frac{dr}{\sqrt{r^2 - a^2}} = \int_{0}^{t} \omega dt$$

$$\ln | r+\sqrt{r^2 - a^2} | \Bigr|\_{a}^{r} = \omega t \Bigr|_{0}^{t}$$

$$\ln \frac{r+\sqrt{r^2 - a^2}}{a} = \omega t$$

$$r + \sqrt{r^2 - a^2} = a e^{\omega t}\tag1$$

Reciprocating,

$$\frac{1}{r + \sqrt{r^2 - a^2}} = \frac{e^{-\omega t}}{a}$$

Rationalising,

$$\frac{r - \sqrt{r^2-a^2}}{a^\cancel{2}} = \frac{e^{-\omega t}}{\cancel{a}}\tag2$$

Adding (1) and (2), we get

$$2r = a(e^{\omega t} + e^{-\omega t})$$

We know that, for no angular acceleration, $$\omega t = \theta$$. 

$$\therefore r = \frac{a}{2} ( e^\theta + e^{-\theta})$$

Here we can see the graph of the trajectory, i.e., this is how the ball will move. You can change the position of $$a$$ to see how it changes the trajectory.
