#### Q4. Consider the previous 3D shape. Assume the function to be $$r = e^x$$. This shape is rotated with constant angular velocity $$\omega$$ about the axis touching the smaller end. Find elongation $$\Delta L$$.

#### Idea:

As in the figure, each part moves in a circle with corresponding radius $$x$$, and each part has tensile forces $$T$$ and $$T+dT$$ acting on both sides respectively. We shall first find the tension $$T$$ as function of the distance from the axis $$x$$. Then, we shall use this to find elongation as in the previous question.

#### Solution:

Since mass can't be constant throughout, let us assume a constant volume mass density $$\rho$$.
We have,
$$A = \pi r^2 = \pi e^{2x}$$

Balancing forces, 

$$F = mR\omega^2$$

$$-dT = (\rho \pi e^{2x} dx)(x)(\omega^2)$$

$$\implies T = -\rho \pi \omega^2 \int_{L}^{x} x e^{2x} dx$$

$$T = -\rho \pi \omega^2 \left( \frac{x e^{2x}}{2} - \frac{e^{2x}}{4} \right) \Biggr|_{L}^{x}$$

$$T= \frac{\rho \pi \omega^2}{4} \left( 2(L e^{2L} - x e^{2x}) + e^{2x} - e^{2L} \right)\tag1$$

Now, we have,

$$dl = \frac{T dx}{\pi e^{2x} Y}

Substituting (1),

$$\implies \Delta L = \frac{\rho \cancel{\pi} \omega^2}{4 \cancel{\pi} Y} \int_{0}^{L} 2(L e^{2L - 2x} - x) + 1 - e^{2L-2x} dx

On simplification,

$$\therefore \Delta L = \frac{\rho \omega^2}{4 Y} \left( 1 - L \right) \left( 1 + L - e^{2L} \right)$$
