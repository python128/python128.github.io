#### Q5. A frustum is made with inner radius $$a_1$$ and outer radius $$a_2$$ on the short end, and radii $$b_1$$ and $$b_2$$ on the larger side. Find the net thermal resistance offered by the hollow frustum if its total length is $$L$$ and thermal conductivity is $$K$$.

#### Idea:

First, we shall find the cross sectional area $$A$$. Then, we can substitute it into the formula for resistance,

$$R = \frac{L}{KA}\tag1$$

We can then integrate it over each part to get to net thermal resistance.

#### Solution:

From the diagram,

$$b = a + L \tan \theta$$

$$\tan \theta = \frac{b-a}{L} = \frac{b}{L+d}$$

Cross sectional area, 

$$A = \frac{\pi b (L + d)}{\cos \theta} - \frac{\pi a d}{\cos \theta}$$

$$\implies A = \frac{\pi L }{ \cos \theta} (2a + L \tan \theta)$$

Substituting this into (1),

$$dR = \frac{L}{KA} = \frac{da}{K\pi L ( 2a + L \tan \theta )}$$

$$\int dR = \frac{1}{K \pi L} \int_{a_1}^{a_2} \frac{da}{2a + L \tan \theta}$$

Substituting the value of $$\tan \theta$$,

$$\therefore R = \frac{1}{2 \pi K L } \ln \left( \frac{a_2 + b_2}{a_1 + b_1} \right)$$

Here, we note that unlike regular conductors, this one is inversely proportional to the length $$L$$.
