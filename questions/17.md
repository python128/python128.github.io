#### Q 17. Consider a 'liquid giant'. A planet made completely of a liquid of density $$\rho$$, and of radius $$R$$. Consider the density of planet to remain constant with depth. A small spherical object if density $$\rho_s$$ is gently dropped from the surface of the planet. Find its position as a function of time.

#### Idea:
 
This question is simple, and all we must do is write the force equation at a general point, as shown in the diagram.

$$F = \rho_s V g - \rho V g$$

$$\implies a = g_s \left(1 - {x \over R}\right) \left( 1 - {\rho \over \rho_s }\right)$$

This is the equation for Simple Harmonic Motion.

$$\implies v = \sqrt{2 g_s \left( x - \frac{x^2}{2R} \right)\left( 1 - {\rho \over \rho_s }\right)}$$

$$\implies x = R \left[ 
1 - \cos \left( t \sqrt{ {4 \over 3} \pi G \rho \left( 1 - {\rho \over \rho_s }\right)} \right) \right]$$

Further, we can find its time period: 

$$T = \sqrt{ { 3 \pi \rho_s \over G \rho(\rho_s - \rho) } }$$
